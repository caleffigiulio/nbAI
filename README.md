Machine learning based predictive modelling for NBA game results

As a project, we will attempt to develop a system that uses historic nba data, and machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for future results.

Currently we will attempt to source data in the form of past nba statistics, possibly using https://github.com/MySportsFeeds

We have yet to select all other tools to use for the machine learning components and modelling systems.
