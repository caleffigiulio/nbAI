Machine learning based predictive modelling for NBA game results

As a project, we will attempt to develop a system that uses historic nba data, and machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for future results.

Currently we will attempt to source data in the form of past nba statistics, possibly using https://github.com/MySportsFeeds

We have yet to select all other tools to use for the machine learning components and modelling systems.


Using the following libraries:

pandas - https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas
SKLearn - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn
TensorFlow - https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
Matplotlib - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib
Scipy - https://github.com/scipy/scipy


Initial Datasets for usage can be found here:

Prospective APIs to be used here:
MySportsFeed python:
